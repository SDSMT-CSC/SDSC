Intro and overview went well.

The presentation made it seem that there were a lot of
details missing with the backlog/sprint section.

Video needed some cleaning up (remove background).  Don't
move the mouse as much in the video.

Problems and future work needed better coverage,
although the answers after were good.

Reduce the acronymns on slides.   Better consistent slides needed.
